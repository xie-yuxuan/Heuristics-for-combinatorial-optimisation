description,"A network of trust relationships among users on Advogato, an online community of open source software developers. Edge direction indicates that node i trusts node j, and edge weight denotes one of four increasing levels of declared trust from i to j: observer (0.4), apprentice (0.6), journeyer (0.8), and master (1.0)."

long-description: This is the trust network of Advogato. Advogato is an online community platform for developers of free software launched in 1999. Nodes are users of Advogato and the directed edges represent trust relationships.  A trust link is called a \"certification\" on Advogato, and three different levels of certifications are possible on Advogato, corresponding to three different edge weights:  certifications as apprentice (0.6), journeyer (0.8) and master (1.0). A user without any trust certificate is called an observer.  It is possible to trust oneself on Advogato, and therefore the network contains loops.

Files: 
    meta.advogato -- Metadata about the network 
    out.advogato -- The adjacency matrix of the network in whitespace-separated values format, with one edge per line
      The meaning of the columns in out.advogato are: 
        First column: ID of from node 
        Second column: ID of to node
        Third column (if present): weight or multiplicity of edge
        Fourth column (if present):  timestamp of edges Unix time
        Third column: edge weight
    ent.advogato.user.name -- Contains the attribute `name` of entity `user` of the network
