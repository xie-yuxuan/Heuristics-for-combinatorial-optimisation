# Heuristics-for-combinatorial-optimisation

This is my IIB project at the University of Cambridge. My specialisation is in Information and Computer Engineering. 

### Abstract
Combinatorial optimisation problems, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem and
Graph colouring, are computationally intractable, requiring approximation methods
for efficient solutions. This project explores various heuristics for solving combinatorial optimisation problems across graph models, aiming to understand the conditions
under which these methods succeed or fail.

### Objectives 
- Conduct preliminary investigations on the performance of greedy and reluctant algorithm on the SK model.
- Generalise and test the algorithms on other similar problems such as graph modularity and stochastic block model with an attempt to build heuristics.
- Apply these heuristics on a vastly different problem and see if these heuristics will still hold. Lastly, to work with real-world network data such as social, biological or system networks, applying these algorithms and evaluating using metrices like Normalised Mutual Information (NMI) to derive any interesting insights for practical applications
