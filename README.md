# Heuristics-for-combinatorial-optimisation

This is my IIB project at the University of Cambridge as I specialise in Information and Computer Engineering. 

### Objectives 
- Explore reluctant vs greedy algo for graph coloring optimisation
- Explore heuristics of approaches

### To do 
1. Graph representation
2. Greedy and Reluctant algo 
3. Optimisation iteration 
4. Validation and visualisation
